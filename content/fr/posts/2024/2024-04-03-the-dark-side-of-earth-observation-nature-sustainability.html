K.A. drafted the manuscript and summarized the analyses performed by M.M.M. and R.W. K.A. led the editing of the final piece. R.J.W.B. and M.M.M. contributed ideas relating to remote sensing and edited the manuscript with the other authors. M.M.M. performed literature searches, drew the figures and estimated the size of global EO data holdings. M.M. contributed ideas relating to data centres and sustainable computing and edited the manuscript with the other authors. J.D.S. contributed ideas relating to remote sensing and sustainable computing and edited the manuscript with the other authors. R.W. performed literature searches, mining EO reports and websites for information. X.Y. contributed ideas relating to EO life-cycle analysis and edited the manuscript with the other authors. K.J.G. contributed various ideas across the whole piece and provided major input to the writing and editing of the piece.
